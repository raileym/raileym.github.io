I am a retired computer scientist, while my cousin is the consummate sales person (never to retire).</p><p class="f4 measure lh-copy">We are both extroverts. For us, staying social has never been a problem. In my case, I have never met a stranger &#8212; I could hold an in-depth conversation with random a person at a bus stop &#8212; and I am not even taking the bus.</p><p class="f4 measure lh-copy">My cousin, on the other hand, is constantly collecting stray cats in the form of single friends, who are forlorn come every holiday. He is always hosting a random party for these single cats.</p><hr class="w5 bg-black"><h2>The question</h2><p class="f4 measure lh-copy">Last year, a good friend &#8212; single &#8212; approached my cousin confessing, 'No one checks up on me, not my adult kids, not my friends. I live alone and I am worried. Is there a technology that I can use on my phone to check in daily with others?'</p><p class="f4 measure lh-copy">Several months later, my cousin asked me the same question, 'Is there such a technology?'</p><p class="f4 measure lh-copy">'Sure, there is a lot of technology out there, but it's mostly quite invasive,' I responded. 'Let's talk more about this question from your friend.'</p><hr class="w5 bg-black"><p class="f4 measure lh-copy">Not surprisingly, everyone has a story that aligns with this friend's observation, 'No one checks up on me.' Whether that person is an elderly neighbor or aging parent or even a young adult in their mid-twenties, we have all read news stories on sad outcomes from being disconnected from others.</p><p class="f4 measure lh-copy">In 2023, our nation's Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek H. Murthysurprisingly, issued a bleak warning as a national advisory on loneliness, titled [Our Epidemic of Loneliness and Isolation](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf).</p></section><footer class=post-footer><div class="post-pagination dt w-100 mt4 mb2"><a class="prev dtc pr2 tl v-top fw6" href=/notes/social-capital/>&larr; Social Capital</a>
