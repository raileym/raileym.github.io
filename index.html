<meta name=description content="In the whirlwind of our daily lives, it’s easy to let meaningful connections slip through our fingers. The UCKN Social Network is here to change that. It’s a unique space designed for you and your groups to make checking in with one another an effortless part of your day. Every day.

With just a simple daily **check-in**, the UCKN Social Network helps keep members connected in groups defined by its members.

Here, it's the little updates, the daily 'here's what I'm up to' that keeps everyone in your chosen groups in the loop and connected.

It’s not about replacing phone calls or dinners out -- it’s about adding a thin layer of connection to your day, no matter how small, to remind us that we’re part of a community.
