(2022, p.2), social connection spans a variety of relationships from strong ties to family and friends to weaker ties to acquaintances and strangers. We speak of those relationships that you can rely upon for support and trust, where such relationships are of high quality and satisfying. Positive &amp;ldquo;social connections [are] vital to our health and wellbeing, while lacking or poor quality social connections [lead to the opposite result]&amp;rdquo; (p.</description></item><item><title>Company names</title><link>/notes/company-names/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/notes/company-names/</guid><description>Photo by Duy Pham on Unsplash
In conversation with ChatGPT I need you to think like a business strategist or a marketing expert.
I have a question about company names, whether I say Club versus Network. Namely, I have two company names to choose from,
UCKN Social Network (uckn.net)
versus
UCKN Social Club (uckn.club).
The spirit behind this company is to enable (facilitate) friends and family to connect (check-in) daily. Nothing more, nothing less.</description></item><item><title>Daily Check-In</title><link>/notes/daily-check-in/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/notes/daily-check-in/</guid><description>With just a simple daily check-in, the UCKN Social Network helps keep members connected in groups defined by its members. It’s about ensuring that, despite the rush of life, there’s always a moment to connect with those who matter. Here, it&amp;rsquo;s the little updates, the daily &amp;lsquo;here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m up to&amp;rsquo; that keeps everyone in your chosen groups in the loop and connected.
It’s not about replacing phone calls or dinners out &amp;ndash; it’s about adding a thin layer of connection to your day, no matter how small, to remind us that we’re part of a community.</description></item><item><title>Define yourself by your next shot, not your last shot.</title><link>/research/tiger-woods/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/research/tiger-woods/</guid><description>On his 12th hole at Augusta National Golf Club during the final round of the 2020 Masters, Tiger Woods scored his worst ever hole in his lifetime. Yet, leaving his 12th hold behind him, Tiger Woods birdied five out of his last remaining six holes.
According to Colter Reed (n.d.), what is most amazing about Tiger Wood&amp;rsquo;s performance after his 12 hole at Augusta, is not his five birdees that followed, but the fact that those five birdees followed his worst shot of a lifetime.</description></item><item><title>How to Combat Emotional Triggers.</title><link>/research/how-to-combat-emotional-triggers/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/research/how-to-combat-emotional-triggers/</guid><description>Johnson (2022, March 25) explains that when someone says they are &amp;ldquo;triggered,&amp;rdquo; what this person means is that some event (a conversation, an observation, an altercation) directly influenced within them an unexpected emotional behavior that can result in negative consequences in mood, anxiety, or emotional state. An unexpected event occurs (the trigger), and the patient responds in response.
Not to put a personal note on this, but I have several emotional triggers, never mind their source.</description></item><item><title>Our Epidemic of Loneliness and Isolation</title><link>/research/epidemic-of-social-isolation-and-loneliness/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/research/epidemic-of-social-isolation-and-loneliness/</guid><description>In 2023, our nation&amp;rsquo;s Surgeon General addressed a silent struggle affecting millions with his release of a profound national advisory titled &amp;ldquo;Our Epidemic of Loneliness and Isolation.&amp;rdquo; This advisory highlights an expansive yet often overlooked health crisis, spotlighting the profound effects of social disconnection in our modern world (U.S. Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services, 2023).
In his advisory, the Surgeon General promotes social connectedness or lack thereof as to what lies at the heart of our troubles.</description></item><item><title>Social Capital</title><link>/blog/social-capital/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/social-capital/</guid><description>Broadly speaking, social capital is the accumulation of the efforts that we put into our relationships with others.

My cousin and I founded The UCKN Social Network. I am a retired computer scientist, while my cousin is a real estate broker.
We are both extroverts — staying social has never been our problem. In my case, I&amp;rsquo;ve never met a stranger — I could hold an in-depth conversation with a park bench.
My cousin is forever the host, always collecting stray friends, who sometimes find themselves forlorn.</description></item><item><title>Typography Styles &amp; Element Examples</title><link>/elements/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Feb 2019 12:27:33 -0600</pubDate><guid>/elements/</guid><description>Font Sizes A A A A A A A A 6rem
