It’s about ensuring that, despite the rush of life, there’s always a moment to connect with those who matter. Here, it&amp;rsquo;s the little updates, the daily &amp;lsquo;here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m up to&amp;rsquo; that keeps everyone in your chosen groups in the loop and connected.
It’s not about replacing phone calls or dinners out &amp;ndash; it’s about adding a thin layer of connection to your day, no matter how small, to remind us that we’re part of a community.</description></item><item><title>Social Capital</title><link>/blog/social-capital/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/social-capital/</guid><description>Broadly speaking, social capital is the accumulation of the efforts that we put into our relationships with others.

Because Speed Building this static site generator theme was the first time I used an Atomic (or Functional) CSS system like Tachyons. It&amp;rsquo;s a design system that provides very small (which means fast) CSS modules that you can use in your HTML. So, rather than writing every line of CSS, you apply the style you need as you write your HTML with easy to understand shorthand class names.</description></item><item><title>Tachyons for Style</title><link>/notes/tachyons-for-style/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/notes/tachyons-for-style/</guid><description>Tachyons is a design system that allows you to design gorgeous interfaces in the browser with little effort.

Since I began building websites in Y2K, I&amp;rsquo;ve lost count how many times the phrase &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;there&amp;rsquo;s got to be a better way to do this&amp;rdquo; has passed my lips. Most times, while fighting with floats and widths of content and sidebars or just basically trying to get something beside something else without using a stupid TABLE.</description></item><item><title>CSS Grid Scaffold</title><link>/notes/css-grid-scaffold/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/notes/css-grid-scaffold/</guid><description>“Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we&amp;rsquo;ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we&amp;rsquo;ve been making websites.” — Chris House, A Complete Guide to CSS Grid Layout 1

My cousin and I founded The UCKN Social Network. I am a retired computer scientist, while my cousin is a real estate broker.
We are both extroverts — staying social has never been our problem. In my case, I&amp;rsquo;ve never met a stranger — I could hold an in-depth conversation with a park bench.
My cousin is forever the host, always collecting stray friends, who sometimes find themselves forlorn.</description></item><item><title>Typography Styles &amp; Element Examples</title><link>/elements/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Feb 2019 12:27:33 -0600</pubDate><guid>/elements/</guid><description>Font Sizes A A A A A A A A 6rem
