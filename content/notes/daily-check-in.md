<h1 class="f2 f1-ns measure-narrow lh-solid">
  I've never met a stranger.
</h1>
<p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
  My cousin and I founded the <b>UCKN Social Network</b>. I am a retired computer scientist, while my cousin is the consummate sales person (never to retire).
</p>
<p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
  We are both extroverts. For us, staying social has never been a problem. In my case, I have never met a stranger &#8212; I could hold an in-depth conversation with random a person at a bus stop &#8212; and I am not even taking the bus.
</p>
<p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
  My cousin, on the other hand, is constantly collecting stray cats in the form of single friends, who are forlorn come every holiday. He is always hosting a random party for these single cats.
</p>
<hr class="w5 bg-black"/>
<h2>The question</h2>
<p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
  Last year, a good friend &#8212; single &#8212; approached my cousin confessing, 'No one checks up on me, not my adult kids, not my friends. I live alone and I am worried. Is there a technology that I can use on my phone to check in daily with others?'
</p>
<p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
  Several months later, my cousin asked me the same question, 'Is there such a technology?' 
</p>
<p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
  'Sure, there is a lot of technology out there, but it's mostly quite invasive,' I responded. 'Let's talk more about this question from your friend.'
</p>
<hr class="w5 bg-black"/>
<p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
  Not surprisingly, everyone has a story that aligns with this friend's observation, 'No one checks up on me.' Whether that person is an elderly neighbor or aging parent or even a young adult in their mid-twenties, we have all read news stories on sad outcomes from being disconnected from others.
</p>
<p class="f4 measure lh-copy">
  In 2023, our nation's Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek H. Murthysurprisingly, issued a bleak warning as a national advisory on loneliness, titled [Our Epidemic of Loneliness and Isolation](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf).

      Grid Layout is a new layout model for CSS that has powerful abilities
      to control the sizing and positioning of boxes and their contents. Unlike
      Flexbox, which is single-axis oriented, Grid Layout is optimized for
      2-dimensional layouts.
