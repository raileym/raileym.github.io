Johnson (2022, March 25) explains that when someone says they are "triggered," what this person means is that some event (a conversation, an observation, an altercation) directly influenced within them an unexpected emotional behavior that can result in negative consequences in mood, anxiety, or emotional state. An unexpected event occurs (the trigger), and the patient responds in response.

Not to put a personal note on this, but I have several emotional triggers, never mind their source. When I am asked, "Why ...," I am immediately offended by the 'why' question, and consider this question as a challenge. In the moment, I do not interpret the 'why' question as a request for more information. On the other hand, I would have felt differently (less defensively) if the 'why' was not so blunt, "You have such an interesting point-of-view. I want to understand where you are coming from, and how you drew that conclusion. Why would you think this ..., but not this ...?" If the 'why' question is wrapped in context, where my friend seeks to understand, then I would not perceive the 'why' question as such a threat.

Johnson (2022, March 25) calls the result of a trigger or stress as an event that can lead to a negative emotional reaction.

When it comes to triggers, those who respond with negative emotional responses often do so repeatedly, as though they are programmed to respond in a certain (negative) way.
