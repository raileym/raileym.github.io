Social capital is the product from building relationships with others. When you hear the question, should I invest time in this relationship, the underlying premise is the question, should you build social captial from this relationship.

Why the word capital? From a financial perspective, capital refers to the accumulation of a sum for a certain purpose. Capital is based on an investment over time, just as one would consider an investment of time and energy towards a positive personal relationship. Just as financial capital is a final accrual of monies, so to is social capital a final accrual for friendship and commaldary.

Social capital is bonding result that forms a group of people who share common experiences, expectations, values or some combination. Building social capital takes calendar time, frequency of connections, and a shared sense of self. 

At school, children are surrounded by opportunities to build social capital. Groups form naturally around school activities from music programs and academic clubs to sporting organizations. Even by virtue of a child's classroom or school, two levels of community, offer opportunies for children to gain social capital.

School peers and formats also offer children to opportunity to learn how to create social capital.

Over time, as we age we tend to focus on our work groups and profession, casual peer groups are harder to maintain. Social capital through work appears more transactional and not steadfast.
