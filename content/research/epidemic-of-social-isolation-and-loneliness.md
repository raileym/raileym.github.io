In 2023, our nation's Surgeon General addressed a silent struggle affecting millions with his release of a profound national advisory titled "Our Epidemic of Loneliness and Isolation." This advisory highlights an expansive yet often overlooked health crisis, spotlighting the profound effects of social disconnection in our modern world (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2023).

In his advisory, the Surgeon General promotes social connectedness or lack thereof as to what lies at the heart of our troubles. 
He notes that while we benefit from social connectedness with our family, friends, neighbors, and community, we can also suffer from the lack thereof.

<!--
He notes that we benefit from social connectedness with our family, friends, colleagues, and neighbors, but also with our community through our neighborhoods, digital environments, schools, and workplaces.

From our Surgeon General's perspective and the many researchers who support his advisory, the degree to which we create social connectedness through whatever means impacts our health and well-being directly. The lack of social connectedness compromises these promised benefits and leads to poor health and other negative outcomes.

Social isolation is objectively having few social relationships, social roles, group memberships, and infrequent social interaction (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2023, p.8). 19, 21

Loneliness is a subjective internal state, [where distress results] from the perceived isolation or unmet need between an individual's preferred and actual experience (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2023, p.8). 9, 10, 19

Badcock et al. (2022, p. 3) distinguish social isolation from loneliness in that one may occur without the other.

Our investments in these sources of social connectedness is called **social capital** by which we gain benefits from these relations commensurate with the effort that we put into them.
