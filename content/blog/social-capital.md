When we spend time and share conversations with our friends and family, we are creating what psychologists call, social capital.

Social capital is the product from building relationships with others. When you hear the question, should I invest time in this relationship, the underlying premise is the question, should you build social captial from this relationship.

Psychologists list the positive aspects of a relationship as trust, comfort, and expectations.
