### I've never met a stranger.

My cousin and I founded **The UCKN Social Network**. I am a retired computer scientist, while my cousin is a real estate broker.

We are both extroverts &#8212; staying social has never been our problem. In my case, I've never met a stranger &#8212; I could hold an in-depth conversation with a park bench.

My cousin is forever the host, always collecting stray friends, who sometimes find themselves forlorn. 

### 'No one checks up on me.'

Last year, a good friend &#8212; single &#8212; approached my cousin, confessing, 'No one checks up on me, not my adult kids, not my friends. I live alone and I am concerned. Is there a technology that I can use on my phone to check in with others daily?'

Months later, my cousin asked me the same question, 'Is there such a technology?' 

'Sure, there is a lot of technology out there, but it's mostly quite invasive,' I'd say. 'Let's talk more about your friend's question.'

Less than a year later, we founded **The UCKN Social Network** as our response to this person's concern. Our goal, at the very least, is to use technology to create social connectedness among our friends, whether we know them or not.

### Surgeon General's National Advisory on loneliness epidemic

Not surprisingly, everyone has a story that aligns with this friend's confession, 'No one checks up on me.' Whether that person is an elderly neighbor or aging parent or even a young adult in their mid-twenties, we have all read news stories with sad outcomes, often with dire consequences.

In 2023, our nation's Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek H. Murthysurprisingly, issued a bleak warning in his National Advisory, [Our Epidemic of Loneliness and Isolation](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf). As reported in this Advisory, social researchers found that isolation may lead to loneliness which impacts everything about us.

- The mortality impact of being socially disconnected is similar to that
caused by smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day (Holt-Lunstad, Robles, & Sbarra, 2017).
- Loneliness and social isolation increase the risk for premature death by
26% and 29%, respectively (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015).
- Poor or insufficient social connection is associated with increased risk
of disease, including a 29% increased risk of heart disease and a 32% increased
risk of stroke (Valtorta, Kanaan, Gilbody, Ronzi, & Hanratty, 2016).
-  Poor or insufficient social connection is associated with increased risk for anxiety, depression, and dementia (Penninkilampi, Casey, Singh, & Brodaty, 2018; Lazzari & Rabottini, 2021).
