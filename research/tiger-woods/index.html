Yet, leaving his 12th hold behind him, Tiger Woods birdied five out of his last remaining six holes.</p><p>According to Colter Reed (n.d.), what is most amazing about Tiger Wood&rsquo;s performance <strong>after</strong> his 12 hole at Augusta, is not his five birdees that followed, but the fact that those five birdees followed his worst shot of a lifetime. It&rsquo;s hard to come back from a failed moment in life (or the 12th hole at Augusta under the lights). The emotions mess with our head. As Reed (n.d.) notes, &ldquo;we focus on our mistakes and discount our successes,&rdquo; which is to say one failure leads to the next, as does one happy moment leads to the next.</p><p>Granted managing our emotions from one moment to the next is not exactly likely flipping a coin. Just because you flip a coin nine times in a row garnering a head does not mean you are more likely to come up heads again on the tenth flip. No, classical probability warns again drawing such conclusions with a fair coin. Having this expectation with a fair-coin is called the Gambler&rsquo;s Fallacy, where one believes that the probability of a [future coin toss] is influenced by previous instances of [prior coin tosses] (The Decision Lab, n.d.)."</p><p>In classical probability, the probability of flipping heads or tails from one occurrence to the next has no bearing on the past. However, when it comes to our emotions, unfortunately, most of us &ndash; Tiger Woods excepted &ndash; carry our emotions forward from one moment to the next.</p><p>Our ability to move beyond our past emotions is called</p><p>timelike who we are at our worst is somehow a more accurate indication of who we really are.</p><p>Tiger Wood&rsquo;s ability to leave his emotions at one hole, and then move emotion-free to the next is his hallmark skill and level of play.</p><h3 id=references>References</h3><p>Reed, C.
